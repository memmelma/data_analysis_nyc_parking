    "# Squad Route\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This project is all about predicting the route of a police squad issuing parking tickets in new york city. Therefore we use the official dataset provided by the city of new york, which documents every single parking ticket issued in the fiscal year 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup & Modules\n",
    "Before running this notebook, make sure that you installed all the used modules (-> modules_install).\n",
    "\n",
    "For saving our files, we chose the *feather* format. In comparison to *csv*, *feather* is a column orientated file format. This improves the reading speed of complete columns up to 30x over csv. Because we always read in the whole columns of the dataset, this format is perfect for our use.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the dataprocessing we use DataFrame's provided by the pandas module. This gives us plenty of options to simply read, modify and save our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If pandas is not enough, we sometimes use numpy, which is a module for linear algebra and array operations."
